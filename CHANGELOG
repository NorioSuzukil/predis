v0.5.1
  * RPOPLPUSH has been changed from bulk command to inline command in Redis
    1.2.1, so ListPopLastPushHead now extends InlineCommand. The old RPOPLPUSH
    behavior is still available via the ListPopLastPushHeadBulk class so that
    you can override the server profile if you need the old (and uncorrect)
    behaviour when connecting to a Redis 1.2.0 instance.

  * Added missing support for BGREWRITEAOF for Redis >= 1.2.0

  * Implemented a factory method for the RedisServerProfile class to ease the 
    creation of new server profile instances based on a version string.

v0.5.0
  * First versioned release of Predis
