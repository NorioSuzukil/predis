v0.x.x
  * New commands added for the Redis 2.0 (DEV) profile: 
      - Strings: APPEND, SUBSTR
      - ZSets  : ZCOUNT, ZRANK, ZUNION, ZINTER, ZREMBYRANK, ZREVRANK
      - Hashes : HSET, HGET
      - Misc.  : DISCARD

  * The GET parameter for the SORT command now accepts also multiple key 
    patterns by passing an array of strings.

  * KEYS will return a multibulk reply starting from Redis 2.0 (DEV). Predis 
    handles this change in a backwards-compatible way.

  * Switched to class-based handlers instead of anonymous functions to 
    handle the various server response types.

  * CommandPipeline and MultiExecBlock return their instances when invoking 
    commands, thus allowing method chaining in pipelines and multi-exec blocks.

  * MultiExecBlock instances can handle the new DISCARD command.

  * Connections can now be identified by an alias using the "alias" parameter 
    in the connection arguments. When connected to a cluster of Redis servers, 
    this is useful to get a certain connection out of a cluster of connections.

  * In addition to the classic way of fetching a whole multibulk reply into an 
    array, the client can now optionally stream a multibulk reply down to the 
    user code by using PHP iterators. It is just a little bit slower, but it 
    can save a lot of memory in certain scenarios.

  * Server errors can optionally be handled "silently": instead of throwing an 
    exception, the client returns a error response type.

v0.5.1
  * RPOPLPUSH has been changed from bulk command to inline command in Redis
    1.2.1, so ListPopLastPushHead now extends InlineCommand. The old RPOPLPUSH
    behavior is still available via the ListPopLastPushHeadBulk class so that
    you can override the server profile if you need the old (and uncorrect)
    behaviour when connecting to a Redis 1.2.0 instance.

  * Added missing support for BGREWRITEAOF for Redis >= 1.2.0

  * Implemented a factory method for the RedisServerProfile class to ease the 
    creation of new server profile instances based on a version string.

v0.5.0
  * First versioned release of Predis
