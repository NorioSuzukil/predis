* Documentation! The README is obviously not enought to show how to use 
  Predis as it does not cover all of its features.

* The included test suite covers almost all the Redis server commands, but a 
  full battery of tests targeting specific functions of this library is still 
  missing.

* Better support for arguments such as WEIGHTS and AGGREGATE [MIN|MAX] for 
  ZUNION and ZINTER.

* Add a PubSubBlock class.

* Missing tests for new commands: 
    PubSub  : PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE
