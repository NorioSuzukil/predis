*** ATTENTION ***

The library code in this branch is currently undergoing a major rewrite and it 
is marked as UNOPTIMIZED, HIGHLY UNSTABLE and will most likely FAIL from time 
to time. The internal API is still subject to frequent changes since its 
design has not been fully finalized yet.

Feedback is obviously appreciated, but use it at your own risk!
